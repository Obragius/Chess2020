# Chess2020
This is to store the chess game which i have made in 2020

Introduction
{
  My learning of programing started with python in 2019. At that time I had no experience and I have decided to create a chess game. I had no intention to follow specific tutorials, and i would only watch tutorials based on a concept or a use of library. It was a project which displayed the baord and the game would be controlled by typing commands in a dialog box which would move the chess pieces. It was a disaster, I had no idea about OOP and all my logic was built on if statements, as well as a broken display board. i have wrote around 4 thousand lines of code and the program would start and crash after 5-6th move. At that time I have gone on holiday and dropped the project. I have made a break for 8 months, and the decided to go back and give programing another attempt. After I've done my basics tic-tac-toe and small scripts, I have gone back to making a new Chess program, now using WxPython, new images, and aquiring more knowledge of programming.
  
  This repository contains different folders for different steps that I took making this program and it has been finished for a while, however I did not use git or github before, and I intend to learn it in future, therfore I'm trying to document my progress.

Versions
{
  This folder is the start of the project, it contains the first version of the original program as well as the last. Other branches of use of this programm are in different folders. This folder also contains several image folders, this is because I have started working with the old images, which are all mine except the background which I have collated from images of the internet (At that time I didn't learn much about the importance of copyright), but I have then asked my relatives to create new images for the new look of the game. Some older versions may require old images. 
  For further information about the latest version of the original programm, you can open Chess2020/Versions/FinalChess.py which has comments on what the functions do and as much as I remember what approaches were taken when solving issues.
